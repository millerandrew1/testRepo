# Welcome to Stock Screener

This project was created by Nikolas Praschma, Justin Adam, and Andrew Miller for our Data Structures & Algorithms course. Stock Screener pulls real-time information about stocks in the NASDAQ using the Financial Modeling Prep financial data API.

The user can filter throgh 6043 stocks based on custom filters. The resulting stocks can be sorted according to certain paramters (e.g. price or marketcap) using the quicksort and timsort sorting algorithms, which we implemented ourselves.

The user can also choose to randomly generate 100,000 stocks and compare the performance of each sorting algorithm.
